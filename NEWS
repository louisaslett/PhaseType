PhaseType 0.2.0
===============

 * Multiple fixes to enable reinclusion on CRAN.
 * In particular dependence on archived HI package removed by bringing in C code
   for ARMS originally written by Wally Gilks, with updates by Louis Aslett to
   pass strict warning and CRAN checks. Previously this code was accessed via
   the HI package.
 * Updates to Fortran BLAS/LAPACK calls to satisfy new string passing
   requirements which will be mandatory from R 4.3.0, per documentation at:
   https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Fortran-character-strings

PhaseType 0.1.3
===============

 * Added ability to have constant multiple of parameters in the generator matrix for phtMCMC2().
 * Improved numerical stability of ECS method in phtMCMC2().
 * Added extra parameter correctness checks to all functions.
 * Corrected some errors in citations.

PhaseType 0.1.2
===============

 * Minor fix due to updated ggplot2 package.

PhaseType 0.1.1
===============

 * Minor fix because of incorrect calls into private R API.

PhaseType 0.1.0
===============

 * First public release
 * phtMCMC() function for Bayesian inference on dense CTMC generator
 * phtMCMC2() function for Bayesian inference on structured CTMC generator
